			<h4>osmium uses the Iridium network to provide Internet access anywhere on the globe, from the flat wastes of the Sahara to the uninhabited North Pole to the peak of Everest.</h4>
			<p>
				Current global Internet services (even according to the companies selling them) are unusably slow, taking thirty minutes to load ten news headlines. With our compression technology, we can provide news, maps, translations, finance data, email, and SMS at near-instant speeds.
				<br><br>
				Using technology recently developed to shrink certain types of webpages to up to one thousandth their original size, osmium's services take hundreds of times less data. Even the most basic websites over current services take 30 minutes to a half hour to load; osmium's services take half a second to 30 seconds to load.
